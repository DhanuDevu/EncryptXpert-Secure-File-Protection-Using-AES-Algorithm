# 🔐 EncryptXpert – Secure File Protection Using AES Algorithm

EncryptXpert is a cross-platform file encryption and decryption tool built using Python, PyCryptodome, and PyQt5.
It allows users to securely protect any file using industry-standard AES encryption modes such as AES-EAX and AES-GCM.
The tool provides both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Command-Line Interface (CLI), making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.
       
## ⭐ Features

AES-EAX and AES-GCM authenticated encryption  

Supports 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit keys

Automatic nonce generation for secure encryption   

Clean & modern PyQt5 GUI

CLI support for automation and scripting

Key + Nonce validation for secure decryption

Optional Key Database System

Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

Clear logs for encryption/decryption operations

▶️ Running the Application
GUI Mode
python EncryptXpert.py


✔️ Encrypt a File

Click Load File(s)

Enter a key in Key (B) (text key)

Select key size → 128/256 bits

Click Encrypt

Note down:

Generated Key (Hex)

Generated Nonce

Your encrypted file will end with .encex

✔️ Decrypt a File

Load the .encex encrypted file

Enter:

Key (H) → hex format of your key

Nonce → the one generated during encryption

Click Decrypt
